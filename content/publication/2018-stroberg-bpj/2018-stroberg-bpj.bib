 abstract = {Cellular condensates-phase-separated concentrates of proteins and
nucleic acids-provide organizational structure for biochemistry that is
distinct from membrane-bound compartments. It has been suggested that
one major function of cellular condensates is to accelerate biochemical
processes that are normally slow or thermodynamically unfavorable. Yet,
the mechanisms leading to increased reaction rates within cellular
condensates remain poorly understood. In this article, we highlight
recent advances in microdroplet chemistry that accelerate reaction rates
by many orders of magnitude as compared to bulk and suggest that similar
mechanisms may also affect reaction kinetics in cellular condensates.},
