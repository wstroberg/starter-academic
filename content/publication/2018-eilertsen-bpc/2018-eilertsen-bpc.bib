 abstract = {A theoretical analysis is performed on the nonlinear ordinary
differential equations that govern the dynamics of a reaction mechanism
of zymogen activation. The reaction consists of a primary non-observable
zymogen activation reaction that it is coupled to an indicator
(observable) reaction. The product of the first reaction is the enzyme
of the indicator reaction, and both reactions are governed by the
Michaelis-Menten reaction mechanism. Using singular perturbation
methods, we derive asymptotic solutions that are valid under the
quasi-steady-state and reactant-stationary assumptions. In particular,
we obtain closed form solutions that are analogous to the
Schnell-Mendoza equation for Michaelis-Menten type reactions. These
closed-form solutions approximate the evolution of the observable
reaction and provide the mathematical link necessary to measure the
enzyme activity of the non-observable reaction. Conditions for the
validity of the asymptotic solutions are also derived, and we
demonstrate that these asymptotic expressions are applicable under
reactant-stationary kinetics.},
