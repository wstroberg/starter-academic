 abstract = {The conditions under which the Michaelis-Menten equation accurately
captures the steady-state kinetics of a simple enzyme-catalyzed reaction
is contrasted with the conditions under which the same equation can be
used to estimate parameters, $K_M$ and $V$, from progress curve data.
Validity of the underlying assumptions leading to the Michaelis-Menten
equation are shown to be necessary, but not sufficient to guarantee
accurate estimation of $K_M$ and $V$. Detailed error analysis and numerical
``experimentsâ€³ show the required experimental conditions for the
independent estimation of both $K_M$ and $V$ from progress curves. A
timescale, $t_Q$, measuring the portion of the time course over which the
progress curve exhibits substantial curvature provides a novel criterion
for accurate estimation of $K_M$ and $V$ from a progress curve experiment.
It is found that, if the initial substrate concentration is of the same
order of magnitude as $K_M$, the estimated values of the $K_M$ and $V$ will
correspond to their true values calculated from the microscopic rate
constants of the corresponding mass-action system, only so long as the
initial enzyme concentration is less than $K_M$. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
