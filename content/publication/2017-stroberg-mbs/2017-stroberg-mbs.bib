 abstract = {The simple bimolecular ligand-receptor binding interaction is often
linearized by assuming pseudo-first order kinetics when one species is
present in excess. Here, a phase-plane analysis allows the derivation of
a new condition for the validity of pseudo-first-order kinetics that is
independent of the initial receptor concentration. The validity of the
derived condition is analyzed from two viewpoints. In the first, time
courses of the exact and approximate solutions to the ligand-receptor
rate equations are compared when all rate constants are known. The
second viewpoint assesses the validity through the error induced when
the approximate equation is used to estimate kinetic constants from
data. Although these two interpretations of validity are often assumed
to coincide, we show that they are distinct, and that large errors are
possible in estimated kinetic constants, even when the linearized and
exact rate equations provide nearly identical solutions. (C) 2016
