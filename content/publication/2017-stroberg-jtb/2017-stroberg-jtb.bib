 abstract = {The origin of cellular compartmentalization has long been viewed as
paralleling the origin of life. Historically, membrane-bound organelles
have been presented as the canonical examples of compartmentalization.
However, recent interest in cellular compartments that lack encompassing
membranes has forced biologists to reexamine the form and function of
cellular organization. The intracellular environment is now known to be
full of transient macromolecular structures that are essential to
cellular function, especially in relation to RNA regulation. Here we
discuss key findings regarding the physicochemical principles governing
the formation and function of non-membrane-bound organelles.
Particularly, we focus how the physiological function of
non-membrane-bound organelles depends on their molecular structure. We
also present a potential mechanism for the formation of
non-membrane-bound organelles. We conclude with suggestions for future
inquiry into the diversity of roles played by non-membrane bound
organelles. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
