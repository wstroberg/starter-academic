 abstract = {Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons produce the central output
controlling fertility and are regulated by steroid feedback. A switch
from estradiol negative to positive feedback initiates the GnRH surge,
ultimately triggering ovulation. This occurs on a daily basis in
ovariectomized, estradiol-treated (OVX + E) mice; GnRH neurons are
suppressed in the morning and activated in the afternoon. To test the
hypotheses that estradiol and time of day signals alter GnRH neuron
responsiveness to stimuli, GFP-identified GnRH neurons in brain slices
from OVX + E or OVX female mice were recorded during the morning or
afternoon. No differences were observed in baseline membrane potential.
Current-clamp revealed GnRH neurons fired more action potentials in
response to current injection during positive feedback relative to all
other groups, which were not different from each other despite reports
of differing ionic conductances. Kisspeptin increased GnRH neuron
response in cells from OVX and OVX + E mice in the morning but not
afternoon. Paradoxically, excitability in kisspeptin knock-out mice was
similar to the maximum observed in control mice but was unchanged by
time of day or estradiol. A mathematical model applying a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo method to estimate probability distributions for
estradiol-and time of day-dependent parameters was used to predict
intrinsic properties underlying excitability changes. A single
identifiable distribution of solutions accounted for similar GnRH neuron
excitability in all groups other than positive feedback despite
different underlying conductance properties; this was attributable to
interdependence of voltage-gated potassium channel properties. In
contrast, redundant solutions may explain positive feedback, perhaps
indicative of the importance of this state for species survival.},
