 abstract = {The determination of a substrate or enzyme activity by coupling one
enzymatic reaction with another easily detectable (indicator) reaction
is a common practice in the biochemical sciences. Usually, the kinetics
of enzyme reactions is simplified with singular perturbation analysis to
derive rate or time course expressions valid under the
quasi-steady-state and reactant stationary state assumptions. In this
paper, the dynamical behavior of coupled enzyme catalyzed reaction
mechanisms is studied by analysis of the phase-plane. We analyze two
types of time-dependent slow manifolds - Sisyphus and Laelaps manifolds
- that occur in the asymptotically autonomous vector fields that arise
from enzyme coupled reactions. Projection onto slow manifolds yields
various reduced models, and we present a geometric interpretation of the
slow/fast dynamics that occur in the phase-planes of these reactions.},
