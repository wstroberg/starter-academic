 abstract = {Cellular protein homeostasis requires continuous monitoring of stress in
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Stress-detection networks control
protein homeostasis by mitigating the deleterious effects of protein
accumulation, such as aggregation and misfolding, with precise
modulation of chaperone production. Here, we develop a coarse model of
the unfolded protein response in yeast and use multi-objective
optimization to determine which sensing and activation strategies
optimally balance the trade-off between unfolded protein accumulation
and chaperone production. By comparing a stress-sensing mechanism that
responds directly to the level of unfolded protein in the ER to a
mechanism that is negatively regulated by unbound chaperones, we show
that chaperone-mediated sensors are more efficient than sensors that
detect unfolded proteins directly. This results from the
chaperone-mediated sensor having separate thresholds for activation and
deactivation. Finally, we demonstrate that a sensor responsive to both
unfolded protein and unbound chaperone does not further optimize
homeostatic control. Our results suggest a strategy for designing stress
sensors and may explain why BiP-mitigated ER stress-sensing networks
have evolved.},
